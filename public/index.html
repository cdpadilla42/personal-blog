              <p>
                Elon Musk announced Friday that his Twitter deal is on hold
                until he receives more information about how many fake accounts
                there are on the social media platform.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a follow-up tweet around two hours later, Musk added that he
                was “still committed to the acquisition.” Twitter’s stock
                plummeted 18% in premarket trading following the initial
                announcement, but trimmed some losses after the second tweet.

                years.
              </p>

              <p>
                The truth is that this isn’t how and when I imagined leaving
                Twitter, and this wasn’t my decision. Parag asked me to leave
                after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a
                different direction.
              </p>

              <p>
                While I’m disappointed, I take solace in a few things: I am
                INSANELY proud of what our collective team achieved over the
                last few years, and my own contribution to this journey. [...]
                I’m proud that we changed the perception around Twitter’s pace
                of innovation, and proud that we shifted the culture internally
                to make bigger bets, move faster, and eliminate sacred cows.

            <p>
              Why would Agrawal make these moves now, while Twitter’s
              future — including Agrawal’s, to be clear — is completely up in
              the air? Idea 1: Agrawal has reason to believe the Musk
              acquisition is going to fall through, so he’s managing the company
              as he sees fit. Idea 2: Agrawal thinks the deal <em>is</em> going
              through and is trying to keep his job as CEO by doing what he
              thinks (or knows) Musk wants done.

              Also from The Verge, an excellent 18-minute cut of the Google I/O
              keynote. It’s kind of funny watching them go from things
              definitely shipping in a few months (Pixel 7 phones) to something
              they plan to ship in “2023” (a Pixel tablet, which looks a lot
              like an iPad but has the front-facing camera on the long side) to
              something with no timeline of actually shipping (AR glasses that
              show live translations of what people are saying to you in

              <p>
                Given that the Pixel Watch is the worst-kept wearable secret of
                2022, there wasn’t anything too surprising in terms of design.
                As suspected, the Pixel Watch has a circular, domed design and
                features a “tactile” crown and side button. It’s made of
                recycled stainless steel and has swappable proprietary bands.

              No pricing announced other than that it will be a “premium-priced
              product”, or word about multiple sizes (a big deal,

                >It looks</a
              >, to some degree (I’d say a large degree), like the design spec
              was “an Apple Watch but circular”. The dome-shaped edge-to-edge
              crystal looks nice. I’m curious if it’s sapphire or glass.

              The rubber strap they’re showing in photos looks a lot like
              Apple’s default sport strap, too, with the Marc
              Newson/Ikepod-style tuck-the-extra-part-under design that Apple
              Watch has made iconic. But, oddly, Google’s straps have two slots.
              The slot after the sizing pin is where you tuck the excess strap.
              I don’t know what purpose the slot <em>before</em> the pin serves.

                According to Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of
                devices and services, this Fitbit integration will go beyond
                customizing watch faces and be “imbued throughout” the Pixel
                Watch experience. Users will be able to sync their data with a
                Fitbit account, meaning they’ll be able to view it within the
                Fitbit app and on the web. The watch will use all of Fitbit’s
                latest algorithms for health and fitness.
              </p>

              <p>
                As for data privacy, Osterloh said in a briefing that Fitbit and
                Google data will stay private and separate due to promises it
                made to regulators during the Fitbit acquisition, meaning that
                any health data collected on the Pixel Watch will remain under
                Fitbit’s purview, separate from Google.

            <p>
              Promises made, promises kept, I suppose, but requiring entirely
              separate accounts for fitness (Fitbit) and everything else
              (Google) seems like an annoyance, not a feature.

              I’d classify this as “not surprising at all but interesting”. This
              is exactly what you’d expect from Disney — they weren’t first to
              streaming, but once they went in, they went in hard and they’re
              going to where their customers are, not demanding that their

            propelled the lineup into what we then thought was the stratosphere
            of popularity), the 2007 Touch, the 2012 seventh generation Nano,
            and the Shuffle.<sup id="fnr1-2022-05-10"

            I suspect most people reading this news will experience two
            thoughts, simultaneously:
          </p>

          <p><em>That’s a shame, I loved the iPod.</em></p>

          <p><em>Wait, they were still selling the iPod Touch?</em></p>

          <p>
            The 7th-generation iPod Touch
            <a href="https://www.imore.com/ipod-touch-7-review"
              >went on sale in May 2019</a
            >; the previous model arrived in 2015. In the latter years of the
            iPhone era, the iPod Touch wasn’t exactly updated on a regular
            schedule. The final models from 2019 had the A10 chip that
            originally debuted with the iPhone 7 in 2016, and started at just
            $200 for the 32 GB base models. ($300 for 128 GB, $400 for 256 GB.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Not only did the iPod Touch never make it to the Face ID era of iOS
            device design, it never even gained Touch ID. It is, today, a bit of
            a retro device.
          </p>

          <p>
            But in its time, the iPod Touch was extraordinary.

            an iPhone without the phone. Alongside the debut of the iPod Touch,
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070914154202/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/"
              >Apple cut the prices of the original iPhone</a
            > — which had only been on sale for a little over two months — by
            $200. An 8 GB iPhone cost $400, and an 8 GB iPod Touch cost $300.
            But the iPhone still required a two-year contract with
            AT&amp;T — with the iPod Touch, you paid $300 (or $400 for 16 GB)
            and owned it free and clear.
          </p>

          <p>
            Turns out, 15 years ago, making an iPhone without the phone meant
            you could make something remarkably thinner. The original iPhone was
            11.6mm thick and weighed 135g. The original iPod Touch was just 8mm
            thick and weighed 120g. The difference in thickness was particularly
            remarkable. It was like a vision of the iPhone’s future. This year’s
            <a
              href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP867?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US"
              >A15-based 3rd-generation iPhone SE</a
            >
            is 7.3mm thick and weighs 144g — much closer in size and weight to
            the original iPod Touch than to the thicker original iPhone.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have two distinctive memories about the iPod Touch and its
            impressive, forward-looking industrial design. The first was in
            September 2012,
            <a
              href="https://www.macworld.com/article/219176/highlights_from_apples_iphone_5_event.html"
              >at the event where Apple announced the iPhone 5, and, alongside
              it, the 4th generation iPod Touch</a
            >. After the keynote, the media were invited to Apple’s usual
            hands-on area. I was hanging around with M.G. Siegler that
            day — Siegler was then covering Apple for TechCrunch — and we were
            among the first to enter the hands-on area. The table (tables?) with
            the iPhone 5 models on display were quickly mobbed. M.G. and I left
            for the table with the new iPod Touch models, which was far less
            crowded. This was the year when Apple added
            <a
              href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/15/8970423/ipod-touch-loop-design-over"
              >a small pop-out loop to which you could attach a wrist strap</a
            >. We both had the same impression: we couldn’t wait to get our
            hands on iPhone 5 review units, but, the 4th-generation iPod Touch
            was thinner and sleeker. It still felt like the future of the
            iPhone, even alongside the sleekest new iPhone to date.
          </p>

          <p>
            The follow-up memory was, I think, from WWDC 2013. Maybe 2014. I was
            on the third floor of Moscone West, before the morning keynote.
            Apple had put out some pastries, coffee, and juice for the media and
            “special guests” who’d been invited to the keynote. I was standing
            around, waiting for the doors to open for the keynote hall, looking
            for friends to say hello to. Mingling, as it were. I happened to
            walk by a man holding what struck me as an iPhone I’d never seen
            before. It was a jolt. It was, to re-use that same adjective,
            sleeker, in some fun color. Blue, maybe? My first thought was that
            he must be an Apple employee using an as-yet-unreleased iPhone
            prototype, inexplicable though that would be to do
            <em>anywhere</em>, let alone in a lobby filled with Apple-centric
            media. Yet he wasn’t being secretive or furtive about it at all. A
            brief moment later I came to my senses and recognized it for what it
            actually was: an iPod Touch.
          </p>

          <p>
            To me, that moment exemplifies the heyday of the iPod Touch. More
            than just an iPhone without the phone, it was a preview of the
            iPhone’s future. Much like, in some sense, the original iPod was,
            too.&nbsp;<a

            <p>Speaking of Zoe Schiffer, she tweeted a scoop:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Ian Goodfellow, Apple’s director of machine learning, is leaving
                the company due to its return to work policy. In a note to
                staff, he said “I believe strongly that more flexibility would
                have been the best policy for my team.” He was likely the
                company’s most cited ML expert.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The New York Post, following Schiffer’s tweet, added this:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Several Apple employees confirmed Goodfellow’s departure on
                corporate gossip site Blind. One Apple employee quoted
                Goodfellow as saying, “I’m leaving for many reasons … but
                Apple’s return to office policy is the biggest single reason.”

                There are few people who have not been touched by Jony Ive’s

                character, preferring mostly to let his work speak for itself.

                interests and the personalities he finds inspiring, the
                magazine’s focus is on the craft of the hand. The project
                started with a simple cover concept: Jony asked that we shoot

                Perhaps our hands have become less necessary in a digital world,
                but in a pandemic of loneliness and isolation, the nuance and
                power of direct touch and connection seems more critical than
                ever.

              <p>
                Our hands have assumed an iconic and cultural importance. They
                are represented and understood as symbols of making, skill and
                industry, as symbols of solidarity, power and resolve. We can
                hold hands. We can punch.

                And of course, our hands both enable our writing, our painting,
                our building and in turn tell unique stories of how we use them.
                They enable us and they describe us.

              <p>
                A group of Apple employees in Maryland launched a union drive
                Tuesday, becoming the third store to make a run at organizing
                the world’s most valuable company. Organizers at the Towson Mall
                store near Baltimore say they have been drumming up support for
                nearly a year in coordination with the International Association
                of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, two employees and a union
                organizer said. They say they have signatures from more than 65
                percent of employees who are likely to be eligible, giving them
                a “supermajority” that would be difficult for the company to
                overcome. [...]
              </p>

              <p>
                The organizers notified Apple chief executive Tim Cook of their
                intention to organize as the Coalition of Organized Retail
                Employees ― AppleCore for short ― in a letter dated Tuesday, a

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Once the Camo app is launched on the iPhone it will keep the
                iPhone awake, even if the camera is not in use or the video feed
                has been paused from the Mac app. I like to manually lock the
                iPhone when I’m not using the webcam. This will prevent the Camo
                Mac app from having a connection to the iPhone app and use the
                camera. That’s the equivalent of using one of those

                I will only be using the iPhone 6 Plus as a webcam and I will
                have it permanently mounted to my monitor, so to make it easier
                to launch the Camo app on the iPhone after the phone have been
                locked, I put the iPhone into Single App Mode using

                >
                and disabled the passcode on the phone. When in Single App Mode
                (sometimes also referred to as “kiosk mode”), the iPhone will
                only be able to launch a single app and the app will
                automatically be launched when the phone is unlocked.
              </p>

              <p>
                Single App Mode can be enabled using Apple Configurator by
                plugging your phone into the Mac and selecting
                <em>Actions → Advanced → Start Single App Mode</em>.... That
                will make the iPhone <em>supervised</em> meaning that its
                features can be restricted from elsewhere by installing
                profiles. After supervision has been enabled, you will be
                prompted to select the app to be used in Single App Mode.

                >, and <a href="https://datajar.app/">Data Jar</a>. Støvring’s
                apps tend to be focused on developer or automation use cases,
                filling holes in the iOS and iPadOS ecosystem to aid power
                users. Runestone mostly falls into the same category, although
                it also has some wider potential appeal for general purpose
                writing.
              </p>

              <p>
                The new app functions as an excellent plain text editor for
                anyone who needs to write on their iPhone or iPad. It’s simple
                and thoughtfully designed, and includes a variety of excellent
                themes to improve your writing experience. Runestone’s marquee
                feature, however, is its syntax highlighting. For Markdown
                writers, the app will use simple color schemes (which can be
                altered to your liking using the theme settings) and subtle
                style changes to highlight your links, bold and italic words,
                footnotes, and more. The result is a very simple, essentially
                plain-text approach which still makes it easy to see your markup
                at a glance.

              I’ve been beta-testing
              <a href="https://runestone.app/">Runestone</a> for a few months,
              and it’s excellent. Fast and intuitive, Runestone looks and works
              great on both iPhone and iPad. Because it integrates with
              <a

              locally on your device and in iCloud, but through any app that
              provides a standard document browser. Dropbox works great, as does
              the excellent
              <a href="https://secureshellfish.app/">Secure ShellFish</a> for

            </p>

            <p>
              Runestone is free to download and use. For a one-time $10
              purchase, “Premium” unlocks a bunch of customization options
              <em>and</em> one of the best Easter eggs I’ve seen in years.

              My thanks to Kolide for once again sponsoring last week at DF.
              Kolide is a SaaS app that sends employees important, timely, and
              relevant security recommendations concerning their Mac, Windows,
              and Linux devices, right inside Slack.
            </p>

            <p>
              Kolide is perfect for organizations that want to move beyond a
              traditional lock-down model and move to one where employees are
              educated about security and device management while fixing nuanced
              problems. For example, Kolide can:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Instruct developers to set passphrases on the unencrypted SSH
                keys littered throughout their devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Find plain-text two-factor backup codes and teach end-users how
                to store them securely.
              </li>
              <li>
                Convince employees to uninstall privacy-invasive browser
                extensions that sell their browser history to marketing
                companies.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3tBWb9h">You can try Kolide</a> on an
              unlimited number of devices with all its features for free and
              without a credit card for 14 days.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Today we’re thrilled to launch a long-awaited feature in Camo:
                full compatibility with Safari, FaceTime, QuickTime, and more.
                As well as adding support for all of Apple’s apps on modern
                versions of macOS, this update also enables all third-party apps
                that previously relied on Camo’s integrations to work natively.
                Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and others now run great with Camo
                without modification.
              </p>

              <p>
                With the release of Camo Studio 1.6 and macOS 12.3, Camo is the
                <em
                  >first virtual camera to be natively compatible with all apps
                  in the Mac ecosystem</em
                >. [...]
              </p>

              <p>
                This change comes as a consequence of two years of conversation
                with Apple on how we can make the most of the incredible cameras
                in their devices. This wasn’t the feature we originally intended
                to ship as part of Camo 1.6, but once we heard the good news
                from Apple we rearranged our launch schedule to make this
                happen. Thank you, team Apple!
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Fantastic news. Camo is terrific software. Using a spare iPhone as
              a webcam is a great way to put an older device to good use,
              <em>and</em> delivers image quality that far surpasses most
              dedicated webcams — including the one built into the Studio
              Display. The biggest knock against Camo, until now, was that
              “virtual webcams” didn’t work with Apple’s own apps.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now what we need is a good mount for using an iPhone with Camo on
              the Studio Display.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                When Playdate shipped, Panic co-founder Steven wrote a little
                about what it meant to him. And in the spirit of doing things
                differently, posted it to a Gopher (!) site.
              </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>
              I took a guess that <code>curl</code> could handle a gopher URL,
              and I was right. From Frank’s piece:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    It’s OK to take risks with design. In a world of metal and
                    glass slabs, a console that vaguely resembles a slice of
                    Velveeta (R) can’t help but catch your eye. I know
                    everything is kind of depressing recently, but color is OK,
                    shapes are OK, and joyfulness can be a feature.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Limitations like monochrome displays and a minimum of
                    buttons and controls are not only rocket fuel for developer
                    creativity, but also broaden Playdate’s appeal to people who
                    may find modern games intimidating or out of reach due to
                    their complexity. Which is not to say that all Playdate
                    games need to be simplistic, but rather that variety is
                    good.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              So happy to see Playdates shipping. I’m even happier to see that
              they’re building such an enthusiastic and clever developer
              community.

              Perhaps, as a watch person, I’m biased, but I found this
              illustrated essay by Bartosz Ciechanowski to be astonishingly fun
              and informative. Even the parts I already knew I enjoyed
              relearning.

              <p>
                In a joint effort to make the web more secure and usable for
                all, Apple, Google, and Microsoft today announced plans to
                expand support for a common passwordless sign-in standard
                created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium.
                The new capability will allow websites and apps to offer
                consistent, secure, and easy passwordless sign-ins to consumers
                across devices and platforms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Password-only authentication is one of the biggest security
                problems on the web, and managing so many passwords is
                cumbersome for consumers, which often leads consumers to reuse
                the same ones across services. This practice can lead to costly
                account takeovers, data breaches, and even stolen identities.
                While password managers and legacy forms of two-factor
                authentication offer incremental improvements, there has been
                industry-wide collaboration to create sign-in technology that is
                more convenient and more secure.

            <p>
              There are few areas in the intersection of things Apple, Google,
              and Microsoft can agree upon, but moving beyond passwords,
              clearly, is one of them.

            Apple Wallet is more than an app; it’s a feature built into the OS.
            The core of the E.C.’s complaint is that they think Apple should be
            legally required to allow third party developers to add features to
            the OS.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              NFC technology was developed by third parties, is standardised and
              available in almost all payment terminals in Europe. There are
              other technologies, such as those based on QR code, that can be
              used for mobile payments. But NFC technology is the most
              widespread in the EU, and allows for the safest and most seamless
              experience.

          <p>
            This passage, as well as much of the rest of the E.C.’s “statement
            of objections”, seeks to dismiss the hard work Apple has done to
            make Apple Pay successful. Yes, NFC is an industry standard, and
            Apple Pay is, in part, built on top of that. But before Apple Pay,
            NFC was hardly used, even though
            <a

              >Android had supported it since 2011</a
            >. When Apple Pay launched in late 2014, its support for the
            existing NFC infrastructure was so good, it worked with many credit
            card terminals that had no explicit support for “Apple Pay”
            specifically.

            just to keep people from using Apple Pay — not for any sort of
            security or anti-fraud reasons, but because Rite Aid was part of the
            consortium behind the then-still-in-the-works

          <p>
            Apple Pay was so easy to use people were using it at retailers who
            weren’t even Apple Pay partners. That’s not a credit to NFC, which
            had been in place for years. That’s a credit to Apple.

              Apple has built a closed ecosystem around its devices and its

              ecosystem, setting the rules of the game for anyone who wants to
              reach consumers using Apple devices. But other app developers
              depend on the access to this ecosystem to develop innovative
              mobile wallets.

            <p>
              The potential for innovation in this space is enormous. But this
              innovation has been prevented by Apple refusing others to access
              NFC on its devices. As a result, various features of mobile
              wallets, such as <em>financial</em> complementary services, are
              simply not available. Because Apple is not challenged, it has
              little incentives to innovate itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              And this is important. Because this market is growing fast. Today,
              Apple Pay, is by far the largest NFC based mobile wallet on the
              market.

            The E.C. complaint wavers between claiming Apple Pay dominates NFC

            <p>
              Apple today announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone. The
              new capability will empower millions of merchants across the US,
              from small businesses to large retailers, to use their iPhone to
              seamlessly and securely accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and
              debit cards, <em>and other digital wallets</em> through a simple
              tap to their iPhone — no additional hardware or payment terminal
              needed. Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available for payment
              platforms and app developers to integrate into their iOS apps and
              offer as a payment option to their business customers. Stripe will
              be the first payment platform to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone to
              their business customers, including the Shopify Point of Sale app
              this spring. Additional payment platforms and apps will follow

          <p>
            It’s the NFC payment terminals in retailers that are built to only
            accept credit and debit cards. With a system Apple has designed
            entirely on its own — the new Tap to Pay on iPhone system — they’re
            including support for other wallets from the get-go. I honestly
            don’t understand where the E.C. sees anticompetitive behavior with
            Apple Pay. What I see is market share dominance stemming from the
            hard work of designing better integration into iOS and iPhones and
            educating users about the feature. How else could the iPhone’s share
            of NFC payments so far exceed the iPhone’s share of mobile phone
            sales? I’m not saying Samsung and Google suck at this, per se, but
            Jennifer Bailey’s team at Apple is <em>really</em> good, and perhaps
            just as importantly, really <em>diligent</em> about this sort of
            thing.
          </p>

          <p>Back to Vestager’s comments:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Apple claims that for security reasons it cannot provide access to
              NFC for payments. According to Apple, security risks would
              increase if access were to be granted to third parties. We take
              security very seriously. Our investigation to date did not reveal
              any evidence that would point to such a higher security risk. On
              the contrary, evidence on our file indicates that Apple’s conduct
              cannot be justified by security concerns.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This dismissiveness on the part of the E.C. is infuriatingly facile.
            Could and should there be APIs that allow iOS apps to make use of
            NFC, securely? I think yes. I also think it’s quite likely that
            Apple is working on them. All sorts of features that were once only
            the purview of Apple in iOS are now open to third-party developers,
            like system-wide alternative keyboards, setting third-party apps to
            serve as default handlers for web browsing and email, and more. But
            there are always going to be features that are rightfully part of
            the system itself. And to a large extent, I think Apple Pay is one
            of them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider the details of how NFC support might work for third-party
            “wallet” apps on iOS. I would imagine it work something like this:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Unlock your iPhone.</li>
            <li>Open the third-party app you want to use.</li>
            <li>Tap a button in the app to go into NFC search mode.</li>
            <li>Hold the iPhone near the NFC terminal.</li>
            <li>Re-authenticate with Face ID to confirm.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Would that satisfy the E.C.? It should, but I don’t know that it
            will, because that’s not as streamlined as paying with Apple Pay:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Double-click the hardware side button on the iPhone (no need for
              the iPhone to be unlocked).
            </li>
            <li>Authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID.</li>
            <li>Hold iPhone to NFC terminal.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Or consider the ultimate in convenience:
            <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212171"
              >riding transit with Apple Pay express mode</a
            >:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Just hold your locked iPhone near the reader. No buttons to click,
              no authentication necessary.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Express mode works with things like car keys, hotel rooms, and
            student IDs, too. This feature is so deeply integrated with the
            system that it can
            <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212171"
              >even work when the iPhone is in power reserve mode when the
              battery is nearly depleted</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don’t see how the security implications of any of these
            features — payments, car keys, getting into hotel and dorm
            rooms — are not obvious.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should third-party wallet apps be allowed to take over the
            double-click-of-the-side-button feature? Should they be able to take
            over the volume buttons and mute switch too? Those buttons have
            been, and should remain, Apple’s purview. (Apple does allow camera
            apps to use the volume buttons as shutter buttons, like the system
            Camera app does, but, for example, you can’t make a game that uses
            the volume buttons as game controls, or an app that uses the mute
            switch to toggle between, say, light and dark modes.)
          </p>

          <p>
            I mean, it’s all just ones and zeroes. Apple <em>could</em> allow
            users to add third-party wallet apps and grant them permission to be
            invoked simply by double-pressing the side button. But what happens
            then? Do you get an extra step where the user has to choose which
            wallet to use, Apple Wallet or a third-party one? Or does the
            third-party one replace Apple Wallet? What happens when you add a
            second third-party wallet app? It would get confusing very quickly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is it limiting that Apple Wallet is the only wallet on iOS? Yes. Is
            it simpler and easier to understand that way? Yes. Is that why Apple
            Pay dominates the contactless payment market worldwide, despite
            Android having supported NFC payments years before iOS did
            <em>and</em> having far larger market share in handset sales? I say
            yes, undoubtedly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is the E.C.’s argument that any third-party app should be able to
            wake up and respond to an NFC tap? As it stands, Apple can
            truthfully claim that using NFC with an iPhone is guaranteed to be
            secure and trustworthy. How could they claim that if they allowed
            third-party apps to take over that role? If that’s not what the E.C.
            is asking for, then the E.C. should describe, explicitly, what it is
            they are asking for.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whose third-party wallet app is being stomped upon by iOS today?
            Who’s the aggrieved party here? To me it’s clear that the wallet
            itself belongs as part of the system. It’s the elements inside the
            wallet that should be open to third-party apps, which is exactly how
            Apple Wallet works. That NFC card readers in retail point-of-sale
            terminals only work with credit and debit cards isn’t Apple’s fault
            or responsibility, and Apple Pay integrates with any and all credit
            and debit cards that choose to support Apple Wallet. The E.C.
            complaint would make more sense if Apple Card was the only card
            Apple Wallet supported, but it’s not.
          </p>

          <p>
            What, exactly, should Apple have done differently that would have
            appeased the E.C.? I genuinely can’t come up with an answer for
            this.&nbsp;<a

            <p>From a report by Matt Krantz for USA Today in October 2014:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Apple Pay contains a variety of major shortcomings that will
                likely limit its ability to be the dominant form of payment in
                the future, according to a UBS note released to clients this
                week by analyst Steven Milunovich, quoting payments expert
                Richard Crone at Crone Consulting. The problems with Apple Pay
                stem from technical shortcomings of the system relative to other
                alternatives and the large fees Apple plans to charge, which
                banks will be eager to escape, the report says.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                What it boils down to is the fact that one technology is
                designed for the users (Apple) and the other is designed for the
                merchants (CurrentC). Normally I’d say that the product with the
                most user appeal will win but the power and size behind the
                CurrentC group is too big to ignore.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                The Supreme Court has voted to strike down the landmark Roe v.
                Wade decision, according to an initial draft majority opinion
                written by Justice Samuel Alito circulated inside the court and
                obtained by Politico.
              </p>

              <p>
                The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching repudiation of
                the 1973 decision which guaranteed federal constitutional
                protections of abortion rights and a subsequent 1992
                decision — <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> — that largely
                maintained the right. “<em>Roe</em> was egregiously wrong from
                the start,” Alito writes.
              </p>

              <p>
                “We hold that <em>Roe</em> and <em>Casey</em> must be
                overruled,” he writes in the document, labeled as the “Opinion
                of the Court.”

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                The release of the 98-page document is unprecedented in modern
                times. In the court’s modern history, early drafts of opinions
                have never leaked before the final decision is announced. And
                early drafts of opinions often change by the time the decision
                from the court is announced.
              </p>

              <p>
                But if the justices announce a decision along the lines of the
                early, leaked draft, it would be a seismic change in American
                law and politics, coming just months before congressional
                midterm elections that will decide who controls power on Capitol
                Hill.

                It’s sobering, shocking to see the words, “We hold that
                <em>Roe</em> and <em>Casey</em> must be overruled,” which the
                opinion reportedly contains. And yet, really it’s not surprising
                at all. This has been an open secret for months. Indeed it was
                inevitable the moment Amy Coney Barrett joined the Court. Still,
                <em>seeing</em> it … In a different way what’s more surprising
                is that a draft opinion leaked. As far as I know that’s totally
                unprecedented. Certainly I don’t think it’s ever happened in a
                high profile case. And here we are.

                    till it works, the ability to give up something that does
                    not work, and the trust in other people to help you
                    distinguish between the two.

                    There is no such thing as being “on time.” You are either
                    late or you are early. Your choice.

                    Every breakthrough is at first laughable and ridiculous. In
                    fact if it did not start out laughable and ridiculous, it is
                    not a breakthrough.

                The rules are simple: arrange the letters in each section so
                every word is valid, across and down. Each puzzle may seem
                difficult at first — but like all my favorite newspaper puzzles,
                it gets easier as you progress. Each step guides you naturally
                towards the solution.

                This is the kind of game I’ve been trying to make my whole

                you like it.

              in bringing joy back into building and shipping software. Tara’s
              project management tools are designed for developers, founders,
              and teams that move quickly and build beautiful products. Tara
              wanted to build project management software they themselves would
              use, where they didn’t have to spend hours finding a ticket or
              syncing to source control, while maintaining 99.9 percent uptime.

            <p>Kate Conger, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Many Twitter employees feel personally invested in the company’s
                effort to encourage healthy conversation — even if they do not
                directly work on content moderation — and have pressed
                executives to crack down further on hate speech and
                misinformation, six employees said. They see Mr. Musk’s proposal
                to revert to Twitter’s early, lax approach as a rebuke of their
                work.
              </p>

              <p>
                But other employees have argued in internal messages seen by The
                Times that their co-workers have shifted too far to the left
                side of the political spectrum, making employees who support Mr.
                Musk’s plans too uncomfortable to speak up. In a worker-run
                survey of nearly 200 Twitter employees on Blind, an anonymous
                workplace review app, 44 percent said they were neutral on Mr.
                Musk. Twenty-seven percent said they loved Mr. Musk, while 27
                percent said they hated him.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/">Blind</a> offers colleagues a
              way to — according to Blind — anonymously chat about and review
              their workplace, where only their fellow colleagues can see those
              internal-to-the-company discussion boards. They verify that
              participants actually work where they claim to work by requiring a
              work email address to sign up. Me, I wouldn’t trust this as far as
              I can throw it, and you can’t throw a website. I might sign up
              just to lurk, but I wouldn’t post a word that I wouldn’t say under
              my name. But that’s just me.
            </p>

            <p>
              A poll of 200 Twitter employees — all of whom are on
              Blind — doesn’t prove anything, but that an evenly-split response
              is not what you’d expect based on the <em>public</em> comments
              from Twitter employees.

              </p>

              <p>
                The site is decidedly different from Apple’s own. The design is
                basic and feels pretty cheap.

            <p>
              Not surprised at all that Apple farmed this part of the Self
              Service Repair Program out to a partner, but the website should
              look more legit. Or at least the website should feature a
              prominent link at the top to Apple’s own website to verify that it
              is legit.
            </p>

            <p>
              I saw folks on Twitter bitching that the tools are rented but
              <a href="https://www.selfservicerepair.com/rental-agreement"

              expensive tools and equipment works.

            <p>Here we go. Clarification from Apple itself:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                As part of the App Store Improvements process, developers of
                apps that have not been updated within the last three years and
                fail to meet a minimal download threshold — meaning the app has
                not been downloaded at all or extremely few times during a
                rolling 12 month period — receive an email notifying them that
                their app has been identified for possible removal from the App
                Store.
              </p>

              <p>
                Apple always wants to help developers get and keep quality
                software on the App Store. That’s why developers can appeal app
                removals. And developers, including those who recently received
                a notice, will now be given more time to update their apps if
                needed — up to 90 days. Apps that are removed will continue to
                function as normal for users who have already downloaded the app
                on their device.
              </p>

                Is this unfair to apps that were complete years ago, like games?
                Others made the point that Gruber expressed most succinctly:
                “Pixar doesn’t have re-render <em>Toy Story</em> every couple of
                years.” That’s true, but the VHS tape of <em>Toy Story</em> you
                bought in 1996 does not work on your Apple TV box attached to
                your 8K TV. You can watch it on that TV with a VCR, but then
                again, that’s the device for which that tape was designed and on
                which you intended to play it. If you want the 4K HD version,
                you have to buy it — and you can, because Pixar did the work to
                create that version.

              Good piece that digs deeper into an issue I admittedly glossed
              over because, well, I didn’t feel like doing the digging. It’s
              always tough to make analogies between software and anything else
              because nothing is quite like software.
            </p>

              One thing I’ve heard from a few developers this week is that
              developers who got this email from Apple, warning them that their
              app or game in the App Store would be removed if they weren’t
              updated, <em>should</em> be able to just appeal to Apple with an
              explanation vouching that the app continues to work just fine on
              iOS 15.4 and that Apple should grant the appeal. Apple isn’t
              culling older apps willy-nilly or blindly. They’re just
              culling — for lack of a better term — abandonware. The other thing
              I’ve heard is that this isn’t new — Apple has been doing this
              every few months for at least five years. This time around it
              caught the attention of the press.
            </p>

            <p>
              So my advice to any developers who got this email (or who get
              similar emails in the future) about apps that are working just
              fine is to appeal. Apple’s automated emails to developers ought to
              mention this, though.

                valuable. I take that back: It’s very good at stirring up
                powerful emotions of love and hate.
              </p>

              <p>
                How do I know? Astro moved in with my family (two kids, two
                moms, one dog) a couple of weeks ago.

                Florida simply cannot promise to prospective bondholders that it
                won’t interfere with Reedy Creek, and then dissolve Reedy Creek.
                If Reedy Creek is ever dissolved, it would be a monumental and
                complicated enterprise even on a years-long timeline. The
                district has a nine-figure annual budget for expenditures, and
                even ignoring its various debts, it has a plethora of other
                contracts that somehow would have to be assigned to and divided
                between Orange and Osceola counties. However, the dissolution
                will have to wait until all of its bonds are paid in full.

                Gov. Ron DeSantis responded to the criticism that repealing
                Disney’s special district would become a burden for area
                residents. [...] He added that Disney will also be required to
                pay all outstanding bonds, but he didn’t explain how it will
                happen.

                “Under no circumstances will Disney not pay its debts,” DeSantis

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Data compiled by The Verge from social media statistics site
                Social Blade shows that in the two days since the deal was
                completed, influential conservative accounts have increased
                their follower counts at roughly ten times the average daily
                rate for the month leading up to the acquisition. Meanwhile,
                popular liberal accounts have suffered, collectively losing
                hundreds of thousands of followers on April 25th and 26th after
                a month of gains. [...]
              </p>

              <p>
                Out of the 50 conservative accounts in our dataset, 48 made
                unusually large follower gains on April 25th and 26th, while
                only two accounts lost followers. On April 26th, the
                conservative accounts in our dataset gained 17,229 followers on
                average. The single largest gain went to Florida Governor Ron
                DeSantis, who gained 141,556 followers.
              </p>

              <p>
                All 50 of the liberal accounts in our dataset lost followers
                across the same two days. On average, each account lost 6,062
                followers on April 26th, with the single largest loss from the
                account of Vice President Kamala Harris, whose follower count
                decreased by 22,453.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              To put this in perspective, it’s worth noting that Vice President
              Harris has 19.6 million followers, so losing 22,500 is about
              one-tenth of a percent. Not precipitous. But, still, I find this
              interesting.
            </p>

            <p>
              Conservative-leaning users joining (or re-joining) Twitter in
              anticipation that under Musk’s ownership, Twitter will be more to
              their liking makes some sense. I don’t really get why
              liberal-leaning users are deleting or deactivating their accounts
              now, though. Nothing has changed. We don’t know what will change.
              It seems so defeatist, which, alas, is on-brand for the
              active-on-Twitter left.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also don’t get deleting your account. Why not just stop using
              Twitter for now, but keep your account in case you change your
              mind down the road?

              <p>
                The main focus of my reviews has always been about CPU
                performance in real world engineering benchmarks, and this is
                where things take a dramatic turn with the Mac Studio. To really
                convey my experience, I want to set the stage with previous
                results from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) benchmark
                I’ve been running for the last 10 years. These results cover
                four generations of pro desktop Mac systems running Intel CPUs.
                [...]
              </p>

              <p>
                As shown above, we see a pretty typical trend where machines get
                less and less efficient as more and more cores join the
                computation. This happens because the computational work begins
                to saturate communications on the system as data and MPI
                instructions pass between the cores and memory, creating
                overhead. It’s what makes parallel CFD computations such a great
                real world benchmark. Unlike simpler benchmarks that tend to
                make CPUs look good, the CFD benchmark stresses the entire
                system and shows us how things hold up as conditions become more
                and more challenging.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now let’s take a look at what happened when I repeated this test
                for the Mac Studio and plotted results on the same chart.
              </p>

              <p>
                Apple may be cracking down on apps that no longer receive
                updates. In
                <a
                  href="https://twitter.com/protopop/status/1517701619374338050"
                  >a screenshotted email</a
                >
                sent to affected developers, titled “App Improvement Notice,”
                Apple warns it will remove apps from the App Store that haven’t
                been “updated in a significant amount of time” and gives
                developers just 30 days to update them.
              </p>

              <p>
                “You can keep this app available for new users to discover and
                download from the App Store by submitting an update for review
                in 30 days,” Apple writes in the email. “If no update is
                submitted in 30 days, the app will be removed from sale.” While
                Apple will remove the outdated apps from the App Store, any
                previously downloaded apps will remain on users’ devices.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              This seems logical on the surface — culling apps that haven’t been
              updated in a while sounds like a good way to keep everything in
              the App Store <em>fresh</em>, for lack of a better word. And there
              have been various technical transitions over the years where
              something like this has been necessary (for some definition of
              “necessary”) like the 32-bit to 64-bit transition.
            </p>

            <p>
              But in practice, there are a lot of apps that haven’t been updated
              in a while that continue to run just fine. It’s often not just a
              matter of opening a project file in Xcode and recompiling to get a
              new build. Sometimes you open an older project and it takes a lot
              of work to get it to recompile against the current SDKs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I get the feeling this has a particularly heavy cost for indie
              game makers — and, ultimately, the players and would-be players of
              their games. We can watch <em>really</em> old movies
              today — movies that aren’t just years or decades old, but
              generations old. We can read works of literature that are
              centuries old. But we can’t play iPhone games that are three years
              old unless the developers constantly devote time and attention to
              making sure they keep up with latest SDKs every 2-3 years? Pixar
              doesn’t have to re-render <em>Toy Story</em> every couple of
              years.
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s a hard problem and I can see the upsides of Apple automating
              the clearing of truly abandoned apps from the App Store, but it
              seems like there ought to be a way for developers of
              not-updated-for-a-while apps and games to just log into Apple’s
              developer portal and hit a button to vouch that they still work
              and don’t <em>need</em> an update. Apple could then only cull the
              apps from developers who didn’t respond.

            <p>
              According to one industry insider, Apple might have already
              secured the most sought-after rights package in all of
              broadcasting and is just waiting for the most opportune time to
              announce it. In a

                href="https://puck.news/ruperts-age-apple-nfl-and-the-bomb-of-the-pandemic/"
                >Q&amp;A article for Puck News</a
              >, the entertainment news outlet’s founding partner Matthew
              Belloni said that while his sources are telling him that Apple is
              in the driver’s seat to secure the NFL Sunday Ticket rights
              beginning in the fall of 2023, others are saying that the deal is
              already done.
            </p>

            <p>
              “One source told me this weekend that the deal is actually done,”
              Belloni wrote, “and is being kept quiet at Apple’s request, which
              I haven’t confirmed and don’t know for a fact; Apple isn’t
              commenting.”
            </p>

            <p>
              If this is in fact true, it would line up with how Apple likes to
              dole out information.

          <p>
            I know nothing about these negotiations between Apple and the NFL,
            but I do think it’s true that if Apple <em>has</em> already secured
            these rights, they’d prefer to keep the deal under wraps until a
            time of their own choosing to announce them. But it doesn’t seem
            feasible to keep the deal under wraps until the NFL’s 2023 seasons
            starts next year. Even if Apple and the NFL keep their mouths shut,
            the media industry is gossipy as hell, and word would likely leak
            from other parties, like Amazon and Disney. Let alone DirecTV, which
            is going to have to tell their longtime subscribers eventually.
          </p>

          <p>
            NFL Sunday Ticket, as currently offered from DirecTV, is by anyone’s
            standards expensive:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The streamer’s baseball package only includes two games per week,
              while the NFL package would allow fans to watch all out-of-market
              games. Currently on DIRECTV, the Sunday Ticket’s To Go plan costs
              $73.49 per month during the season or $293.96 for the season while
              their Max Plan — which also includes NFL RedZone and DIRECTV’s
              Fantasy Zone — runs $99 per month and $395.99 for the season.
            </p>

            <p>
              If Apple wanted to make one of those options available to all
              subscribers, it would undoubtedly require an increase in their
              monthly subscription fee, or the more likely option is that they
              would keep the monthly fee at the low $4.99 level and make Sunday
              Ticket available for an add-on price. The question then becomes,
              how much does the streamer charge for the a la carte option?
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            I don’t know about the “undoubtedly” there. It seems unlikely, I
            agree, that Apple would pay $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket
            rights and then just include those games as part of the standard TV+
            subscription, for all users. I think it’s even <em>less</em> likely
            that Apple would raise the prices for all TV+ users, whether they’re
            interested in NFL football or not. (TV+ is a worldwide service, for
            one thing, and in some countries, “football” is a different sport.)
            But it doesn’t seem <em>impossible</em> to me that Apple would just
            include Sunday Ticket for all TV+ subscribers, without raising the
            price. The question is, why does Apple want to stream NFL games? To
            make money directly from those games, or to get as many people as
            possible to try TV+ and eventually subscribe?
          </p>

          <p>
            Some quick back-of-the-envelope math. At $5/month an Apple TV+
            subscriber pays Apple $60/year. $2 billion divided by $60 comes to
            about 33 million — that’s how many new TV+ subscribers Apple would
            need to add, based on Sunday Ticket alone, to break even on the
            deal. (For the sake of argument, let’s just say that family plan and
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/"
              >Apple One bundle subscribers</a
            >
            are paying about $5/month for TV+ content too, as part of their
            subscription tiers. It also seems possible that the rights for
            Sunday Ticket might sell for more like $2.5 billion. Half a billion
            dollars here, half a billion dollars there — it adds up.)
          </p>

            <a
              href="https://nflcommunications.com/Documents/NFL%202021%20Viewership.pdf"
              >According to the NFL, regular season games last year averaged 17
              million total viewers</a
            >. It’s worth noting, though, that average viewership is driven
            primary by <em>in</em>-market games, not out-of-market games. Most
            NFL fans watch one game on Sundays: their local team, via local TV.
            The games broadcast on your local TV channels are geo-excluded from
            Sunday Ticket — to watch them, you need to either watch on
            traditional TV or via a streaming service that includes your local
            TV channels. “All the Sunday afternoon games <em>except</em> for
            your favorite team” is not a selling point for most NFL fans.
          </p>

          <p>
            The top-rated national broadcast, NBC’s Sunday Night Football,
            <a
              href="https://deadline.com/2022/01/tom-brady-nfl-sunday-night-football-viewership-rise-tv-history-nbc-1234908545/"
              >averaged 18.5 million viewers per week last year</a
            >. But Sunday Ticket doesn’t include the Thursday, Sunday, and
            <a

              >Monday night</a
            >
            national games, which the NFL sells the rights to separately. I’m
            just including Sunday Night Football’s viewership for context.
          </p>

          <p>
            So can Apple feasibly get 30+ million new TV+ subscribers just by
            offering access to NFL Sunday Ticket with a standard TV+
            subscription? That doesn’t seem possible. But that doesn’t mean they
            wouldn’t do it anyway, just to drive TV+ subscriptions by
            <em>some</em> number of millions of additional subscribers, and by
            raising awareness of TV+ in general.
          </p>

          <p>
            If Apple does get the rights to Sunday Ticket, and they do choose to
            charge subscribers a premium for access to it, I think there’s a
            good chance that they’ll charge substantially less than DirecTV’s
            rates — that Apple will still try to make it more of a mass-market
            play for regular NFL fans, not just for superfans and gambling
            junkies.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am reminded of Fox obtaining the broadcast rights for NFL games
            back in 1993. A few years ago
            <a
              href="https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/12/13/18137938/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc"
              >The Ringer put together a good oral history of that deal</a
            >. Fox spent a then-record $1.6 billion for the rights to the NFC
            games that had theretofore been broadcast on CBS, and they hired
            away all of CBS’s broadcasting talent, including John Madden. The
            point wasn’t just to put the best NFL games on Fox, the point was to
            put Fox itself on the map, to establish Fox as a peer to the big
            three traditional networks.
          </p>

          <p>
            To me, that should be the point of Apple securing the rights to
            Sunday Ticket. Not just to get NFL games on Apple TV+, but to
            further cement TV+ as a top-shelf streaming service.&nbsp;<a
